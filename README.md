Tether is a JavaScript library for efficiently making an absolutely positioned element stay next to another element on the page.

It aims to be the canonical implementation of this type of positioning, such that you can build products, not positioning libraries.

Take a look at the documentation for a more detailed explanation of why you should star it now to remember it for your next project.

## What to Use Tether for and When to Use It 

Most websites contain at least one overlapping element that needs to be displayed. These elements include:
* Dropdown Menus
* Tooltips
* Infoboxes

You can either use Tether to save yourself work implementing these features or you can use specific libraries built around Tether for these specific interactions. 

Some other features of Tether include:
* Optional optimizations depending on use
* Dynamic anchor points
* Positional constraints

You can check the API Documentation link below under *Usage* for more details on those libraries as well as Tether.

### Restrictions
Tether currently supports IE9+ and other modern browsers.
